    <h3>A meditation retreat for neurodivergent humans</h3>

    <!-- Intro Section -->
    <section class="intro">
      <p>Hey friends!</p>

      <p>
        My name is Jeff Warren. I'm an ADHD and bipolar meditation teacher and writer, author of a couple books, in a couple meditation apps - Calm, Happier - as well as Substack. My partner Sarah is autistic and has ADHD. Who knows what the heck my two kids are. I'm surrounded by neurospicy humans and this has led to my primary passion in life, which is figuring out how to customize meditation and mental / emotional / spiritual practices for different nervous systems.
      </p>

      <p>
        Next July 2026 I'm finally gonna put some of these ideas into practice with my first annual retreat for neurodivergent humans. There will be meditation, that's definitely part of it, although one of the things you'll learn is there's a lot of variety possible here. And there will be other kinds of creative practices too, from movement to art to simply sharing best strategies for getting through this strange and hard and beautiful life.
      </p>

      <p>
        Joining me will be meditation teacher and poet / performer <a href="https://bornimusic.com/" target="_blank"> Orfosu Jones-Quartey</a>, who has learned much about practice through working with his OCD. Rachel and Maty will be in support, along with a neurodivergent-affirming psychotherapist.
